I took the S1 bus to Khao San Road, the busiest place for back packers in all of SE Asia. On the bus I met a fellow solo traveler, Chloe. We grabbed something to eat nearby and “massively overpaid” (200B ~ 5€ for a soup), it was still delicious though. Overall we were a bit underwhelmed by Khao San Road, but it was also 10 in the morning and most things were closed. After that I checked into the Hostel about 20 minutes (by foot) south of Khao San Road. I checked in and went for a little walk around the area, Saranrom Park, a smaller temple, and the Grand Temple. Unprepared as I was, no hat, no water, blissfully walking outside of the shade, the heat was beating me down. At some point I started getting light headed and bought a lemonade from a street food truck. I didn’t trust the ice cubes, which look non-uniform enough that I guessed they must’ve been made from tap water, but that was less important than dehydrating in the heat. I was honestly shocked by the oppressive combination of heat and high humidity, which I haven’t experienced before.\nI didn’t actually end up seeing the Grand Temple, but had to abort early and make my way back to the Hostel, which has AC, to cool down. I was already sweaty and smelly before, but at this point I felt positively disgusting (I could smell myself a LOT) and was dying for a shower, which I took.\nAfter I felt like a human again I met Sebas and Ceci at Khao San Road. We went for some beers, caught up with each other (I showed him my battle scars from las tracas valenciano), had street food (Pad Thai for about 50B ~ 1.25€), did some shopping, listened to some live music, and booked a tour to the flower markets for the next day at mama travel. Btw, beer prices are not that far off from cheaper locations in europe. A large (strangely large actually, 625ml) Singha beer will run you between 120 and 150B, so around 3-4€. If I remember correctly that is about what you pay in the cheaper places in Andalusia. Around this time, Khao San Road also was as loud, busy, and exciting as everyone says it is, so missino accomplished. At around midnight, we decided to call it a day and I went on my way back to the hostel.\nTu 2023-04-18 After a night of pretty good sleep, I woke up reasonably early to be ready to be picked up at my hostel at around 8:30. I got picked up by our driver, which had picked up Sebas and Ceci already, and it turned out we will be getting a private tour. The first stop was the railroad market after about 90 minutes of driving. There is a train from Mae Klong to Bangkok and the market is set up on the sides of the Mae Klong part of it. At the time we were there, the train would go by 2 times per day, as it is low season. When the train is about to go through the market, everyone packs up their wares so that they are not in the volume that will be taken up by the train. If that sounds strangely specific then that’s because it is a very precise operation. There are lines drawn on the ground that people need to stay behind. If you do that, which you should, you will have maybe 5-10cm of room between you and the train. It’s clearly a show put on for tourists, but it was fun none the less. If you venture a little off to the side of the actual train tracks you will find a much bigger market, which is also used for shopping by the locals. Here we bought ourselves some mangosteens and then ate them while we were on our way back to the cab. They’re absolutely delicous. They juicy, tart, sweet, by memory I would describe it as inbetween citrus and the “exotic” flavor you can buy as a juice.\nSecond stop on our tour were the floating markets. We had big expectations. Looking at the pictures, you see the canal buzzing with merchants on wooden kayaks peddling their wares to customers and each other. So we get into our long tail boat, the wooden boats with an over-sized engine mounted in the back and the several meters long axle just going straight from it to the water (hence long tail boats) and go down the river. If I had to guess, I’d put the ratio of merchants and tourists as somewhere around 1. And pretty much all of them are selling the standard souvenirs you can find on any corner. The boat tour itself was a bit awkward and I felt a bit like cattle being lead to (or rather through) the milking station. It was fun seeing some of the crazy long tail boats, though. After the canal drive we asked our driver for recommendations on where to get some food and he pointed us to a place a few meters outside of the main area. We got some delicious food (papaya salad, tom kha gai, and I forgot the last one) and went shopping. I finally bought some hippie pants that I was looking forward to (intentionally no elephant on them, though). On the way back we took a nap and asked the driver if he can drop us off at china town.\nChinatown was fantastic, it’s massive, it’s loud, it’s hectic, everything you expect from Bangkok. When you’re in one of the markets that are covered by a roof, the street is about 2m wide and jam packed with people, which of course doesn’t stop scooter drivers from going through there so it pays to watch your head. We did some shopping here as well and got some street food and then decided have a quick jump into the pool at Sebas’ and Ceci’s hotel. Sadly that didn’t work because they wanted more than 10€ from non-guest which we decided is too steep for an hour or so at the pool. So instead we went to a nearby bar and got ready for the evening program (meaning we had a beer).\nThe plan for the evening was to check out a chinese restaurant that sells whole piglets that Sebas and Ceci have seen on youtube. So we hailed a cab and went on our way. When we arrived after a pretty lengthy drive for something that’s still within Bangkok city, we weren’t sure if it was the right place. What we arrived at looked like a car mechanic’s garage and the look our driver gave us did not inspire confidence. But a bit further in the back we actually did see something that looked like a restaurant and went in. We were the only Farangs (europeans) there, which was a nice change but on the flip side nobody there spoke even a word of english. However, the word “Singha” is not english and our index fingers worked just fine pointing to the whole piglet (1.9kg for 3 people) on the menu did the trick. It arrived pretty quickly and looked like a really nicely roasted pig. The skin was cut into little squares and laid on top of it, so we jumped on that first. To our surprise, there was no seasoning at all on the whole pig, but the sauces really helped. We clearly ate it incorrectly because the waiters were giggling the whole time we were eating, but of course the language barrier made it impossible for us to investigate. We decided that they’re having fun and we’re also having fun, so just continued in our incorrect ways. Overall a slightly strange but great experience. After that we grabbed a beer at another bar and then went home.\n",

<p>After an uneventful flight, I arrived in Thailand early in the morning. I took the S1 bus to Khao San Road, the busiest place for back packers in all of SE Asia.
